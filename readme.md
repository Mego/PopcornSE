#PopcornSE

Thanks to Stack Exchange's _amazing_ userbase, flags are handled faster than lightspeed, so for some of us, who aren't Speedy McNinja, you can use PopcornSE to see flags, moderator flags (I'm not sure how this works exactly) and user suspensions after they happen in a convenient little popup.

[Click here to install](https://github.com/The-Quill/PopcornSE/raw/master/PopcornSE.user.js).

This should work for most browsers, but if you encounter a problem, please make a GitHub issue.
